# Ransomware Simulation and Detection

This project simulates ransomware activity by encrypting files in a specified directory and providing mechanisms to detect and decrypt those files. It is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate how ransomware operates and how it can be detected and mitigated.

## Features

- **Ransomware Simulation**: Encrypt files in a directory to simulate a ransomware attack.
- **Ransom Note Generation**: Create ransom notes in the affected directories.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt the encrypted files using the previously generated key.
- **Detection**: Monitor directories for suspicious file activity.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- `cryptography` library

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ransomware_simulation_detection.git
   cd ransomware_simulation_detection


2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install cryptography


3. **Create Directory and Sample Files:**
    ```sh
    mkdir -p simulation/directory_to_encrypt
    echo "This is a sample file." > simulation/directory_to_encrypt/sample.txt



## Usage

**Encrypt Files**
    Navigate to the simulation directory and run the encryptor.py script to encrypt files in the directory_to_encrypt directory.
    ```sh
    cd simulation
    python3 encryptor.py


**Decrypt Files**
    To decrypt the files, run the decryptor.py script. Ensure the ransomware_key.key file is present in the simulation directory.
    ```sh
    python3 decryptor.py


**Detect Ransomware Activity**
    Navigate to the detection directory, configure config.yml as needed, and run the detector.py script.
    ```sh
    cd ../detection
    python3 detector.py


## Configuration

The config.yml file in the detection directory should be configured with the following:

    yaml
    encryption_key_path: "path/to/ransomware_key.key"
    directory_to_monitor: "path/to/directory_to_monitor"
    alert_email: "your_email@example.com"
    smtp_server: "your_smtp_server"
    smtp_port: 587
    smtp_login: "your_smtp_login"
    smtp_password: "your_smtp_password"


## Logging
Logs are stored in detection/logs/detection.log.
